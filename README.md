## Typicka (Name subject to change)

A simple RPG game made with Game Maker Studio, which not only has most conventions of a 2D platformer, but also utilizes the keyboard (akin to text based adventures) to "load" spells and skills to solve puzzles and fight enemies.

## Motivation

A lot of games designed to learn typing are done in a mediocre, non-immersive manner. “Games” such as "Type-To-Learn" offer challenges that consist of no more than typing out irrelevant (or illegible) words to achieve a high score. Other games such as Typing of the Dead places a more “game-like” setting (more specifically, a rail shooter) but immersion is still broken through the typing of irrelevant words to kill monsters. Players are bound to think “why would I type ‘daffodil’ to kill a zombie? How does that even make sense?” At the very least, most players will agree that they would rather play another game than a game designed around typing education.

Typicka aims to alleviate such issues by creating a typing environment that is immersive, makes basic sense to the player, and ultimately is fun. Through this environment, players will be more inclined to play the game, and more importantly, inclined to get better at the game (in other words, get better at typing), which ultimately achieves the goals of a basic typing game.

## To Do

Typicka is still in its early prototype stages.

The following are short-term features to implement:

* Stylized text boxes for the play and non-players to use
* Execution of very basic spells (bolt, claw) upon use
* Interacting with NPCs
* Battle scenes
